## Installation

### For [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

#### npm

To publish the library as a [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), please follow the procedure in ["Publishing npm packages"](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/publishing-npm-packages).

Then install it via:

```shell
npm install selling_partner_api_for_uploads --save
```

Finally, you need to build the module:

```shell
npm run build
```

##### Local development

To use the library locally without publishing to a remote npm registry, first install the dependencies by changing into the directory containing `package.json` (and this README). Let's call this `JAVASCRIPT_CLIENT_DIR`. Then run:

```shell
npm install
```

Next, [link](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/link) it globally in npm with the following, also from `JAVASCRIPT_CLIENT_DIR`:

```shell
npm link
```

To use the link you just defined in your project, switch to the directory you want to use your selling_partner_api_for_uploads from, and run:

```shell
npm link /path/to/<JAVASCRIPT_CLIENT_DIR>
```

Finally, you need to build the module:

```shell
npm run build
```

#### git

If the library is hosted at a git repository, e.g.https://github.com/GIT_USER_ID/GIT_REPO_ID
then install it via:

```shell
    npm install GIT_USER_ID/GIT_REPO_ID --save
```

### For browser

The library also works in the browser environment via npm and [browserify](http://browserify.org/). After following
the above steps with Node.js and installing browserify with `npm install -g browserify`,
perform the following (assuming *main.js* is your entry file):

```shell
browserify main.js > bundle.js
```

Then include *bundle.js* in the HTML pages.

### Webpack Configuration

Using Webpack you may encounter the following error: "Module not found: Error:
Cannot resolve module", most certainly you should disable AMD loader. Add/merge
the following section to your webpack config:

```javascript
module: {
  rules: [
    {
      parser: {
        amd: false
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Getting Started

Please follow the [installation](#installation) instruction and execute the following JS code:

```javascript
var SellingPartnerApiForUploads = require('selling_partner_api_for_uploads');


var api = new SellingPartnerApiForUploads.UploadsApi()
var marketplaceIds = ["null"]; // {[String]} The marketplace ID is the globally unique identifier of a marketplace. To find the ID for your marketplace, refer to [Marketplace IDs](https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api/docs/marketplace-ids).
var contentMD5 = "contentMD5_example"; // {String} An MD5 hash of the content to be submitted to the upload destination. This value is used to determine if the data has been corrupted or tampered with during transit.
var resource = "resource_example"; // {String} The upload destination for your resource. For example, if you create an upload destination for the `createLegalDisclosure` operation of the Messaging API, the `{resource}` would be `/messaging/v1/orders/{amazonOrderId}/messages/legalDisclosure`, and the entire path would be `/uploads/2020-11-01/uploadDestinations/messaging/v1/orders/{amazonOrderId}/messages/legalDisclosure`. If you create an upload destination for an Aplus content document, the `{resource}` would be `aplus/2020-11-01/contentDocuments` and the path would be `/uploads/2020-11-01/uploadDestinations/aplus/2020-11-01/contentDocuments`.
var opts = {
  'contentType': "contentType_example" // {String} The content type of the file you upload.
};
api.createUploadDestinationForResource(marketplaceIds, contentMD5, resource, opts).then(function(data) {
  console.log('API called successfully. Returned data: ' + data);
}, function(error) {
  console.error(error);
});


```
