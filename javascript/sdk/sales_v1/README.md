## Installation

### For [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

#### npm

To publish the library as a [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), please follow the procedure in ["Publishing npm packages"](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/publishing-npm-packages).

Then install it via:

```shell
npm install selling_partner_api_for_sales --save
```

Finally, you need to build the module:

```shell
npm run build
```

##### Local development

To use the library locally without publishing to a remote npm registry, first install the dependencies by changing into the directory containing `package.json` (and this README). Let's call this `JAVASCRIPT_CLIENT_DIR`. Then run:

```shell
npm install
```

Next, [link](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/link) it globally in npm with the following, also from `JAVASCRIPT_CLIENT_DIR`:

```shell
npm link
```

To use the link you just defined in your project, switch to the directory you want to use your selling_partner_api_for_sales from, and run:

```shell
npm link /path/to/<JAVASCRIPT_CLIENT_DIR>
```

Finally, you need to build the module:

```shell
npm run build
```

#### git

If the library is hosted at a git repository, e.g.https://github.com/GIT_USER_ID/GIT_REPO_ID
then install it via:

```shell
    npm install GIT_USER_ID/GIT_REPO_ID --save
```

### For browser

The library also works in the browser environment via npm and [browserify](http://browserify.org/). After following
the above steps with Node.js and installing browserify with `npm install -g browserify`,
perform the following (assuming *main.js* is your entry file):

```shell
browserify main.js > bundle.js
```

Then include *bundle.js* in the HTML pages.

### Webpack Configuration

Using Webpack you may encounter the following error: "Module not found: Error:
Cannot resolve module", most certainly you should disable AMD loader. Add/merge
the following section to your webpack config:

```javascript
module: {
  rules: [
    {
      parser: {
        amd: false
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Getting Started

Please follow the [installation](#installation) instruction and execute the following JS code:

```javascript
var SellingPartnerApiForSales = require('selling_partner_api_for_sales');


var api = new SellingPartnerApiForSales.SalesApi()
var marketplaceIds = ["null"]; // {[String]} A marketplace identifier. This specifies the marketplace in which the order was placed. Only one marketplace can be specified.  For example, ATVPDKIKX0DER indicates the US marketplace.
var interval = "interval_example"; // {String} A time interval used for selecting order metrics. This takes the form of two dates separated by two hyphens (first date is inclusive; second date is exclusive). Dates are in ISO8601 format and must represent absolute time (either Z notation or offset notation). Example: 2018-09-01T00:00:00-07:00--2018-09-04T00:00:00-07:00 requests order metrics for Sept 1st, 2nd and 3rd in the -07:00 zone.
var granularity = "granularity_example"; // {String} The granularity of the grouping of order metrics, based on a unit of time. Specifying granularity=Hour results in a successful request only if the interval specified is less than or equal to 30 days from now. For all other granularities, the interval specified must be less or equal to 2 years from now. Specifying granularity=Total results in order metrics that are aggregated over the entire interval that you specify. If the interval start and end date donâ€™t align with the specified granularity, the head and tail end of the response interval will contain partial data. Example: Day to get a daily breakdown of the request interval, where the day boundary is defined by the granularityTimeZone.
var opts = {
  'granularityTimeZone': "granularityTimeZone_example", // {String} An IANA-compatible time zone for determining the day boundary. Required when specifying a granularity value greater than Hour. The granularityTimeZone value must align with the offset of the specified interval value. For example, if the interval value uses Z notation, then granularityTimeZone must be UTC. If the interval value uses an offset, then granularityTimeZone must be an IANA-compatible time zone that matches the offset. Example: US/Pacific to compute day boundaries, accounting for daylight time savings, for US/Pacific zone.
  'buyerType': "'All'", // {String} Filters the results by the buyer type that you specify, B2B (business to business) or B2C (business to customer). Example: B2B, if you want the response to include order metrics for only B2B buyers.
  'fulfillmentNetwork': "fulfillmentNetwork_example", // {String} Filters the results by the fulfillment network that you specify, MFN (merchant fulfillment network) or AFN (Amazon fulfillment network). Do not include this filter if you want the response to include order metrics for all fulfillment networks. Example: AFN, if you want the response to include order metrics for only Amazon fulfillment network.
  'firstDayOfWeek': "'Monday'", // {String} Specifies the day that the week starts on when granularity=Week, either Monday or Sunday. Default: Monday. Example: Sunday, if you want the week to start on a Sunday.
  'asin': "asin_example", // {String} Filters the results by the ASIN that you specify. Specifying both ASIN and SKU returns an error. Do not include this filter if you want the response to include order metrics for all ASINs. Example: B0792R1RSN, if you want the response to include order metrics for only ASIN B0792R1RSN.
  'sku': "sku_example" // {String} Filters the results by the SKU that you specify. Specifying both ASIN and SKU returns an error. Do not include this filter if you want the response to include order metrics for all SKUs. Example: TestSKU, if you want the response to include order metrics for only SKU TestSKU.
};
api.getOrderMetrics(marketplaceIds, interval, granularity, opts).then(function(data) {
  console.log('API called successfully. Returned data: ' + data);
}, function(error) {
  console.error(error);
});
